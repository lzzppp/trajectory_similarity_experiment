# SERM

This is the code of CIKM 17 short paper: "SERM: A Recurrent Model for Next Location Prediction in Semantic Trajectories".

## About
In this repository, we propose a RNN-based model, namely SERM, to predict next location of LBSN users. SERM considers both squencial relations and semantic influence to generate the prediction result. 

## Files
There are four python files in the root path.

| config.py |  All configurations in SERM model. |
| eval_tool.py |   Evaluation functions and tools.   | 
| geo_data_decoder.py | Preprocessing for both New York Foursquare and Los Angelos Geo-Tweets. |
| train.py| Training procedure of SERM. This is the entrace of SERM model. |
